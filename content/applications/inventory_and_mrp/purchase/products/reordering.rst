Configure reordering rules
==========================

For certain products, it is necessary to ensure that there is always a minimum amount available on
hand at any given time. By adding a reordering rule to a product, it is possible to automate the
reordering process so that a purchase order is automatically created whenever the amount on hand
falls below a set threshold.

.. important::
   The *Inventory* module must be installed to use reordering rules.

Configure products for reordering
=================================

Products must be configured in a specific way before a reordering rule can be added to them. Create
a new product by going to the *Inventory*, *Manufacturing*, *Purchase*, or *Sales* module and
selecting :menuselection:`Products --> Products --> Create`. To allow for reordering, make sure
that the :guilabel:`Can be Purchased` checkbox is activated and the :guilabel:`Product Type`
dropdown is set to `Storable Product`.

Add a reordering rule to a product
==================================

After properly configuring a product, a reordering rule can be added to it by navigating to the
product page and selecting :menuselection:`Reordering Rules --> Create`.

Once created, the reordering rule can be configured to generate purchase orders automatically.

- :guilabel:`Location` specifies where the ordered quantities should be stored once they are
  received and entered into stock.
- :guilabel:`Min Quantity` sets the lower threshold for the reordering rule while :guilabel:`Max
  Quantity` sets the upper threshold. If the stock on hand falls below the minimum quantity, a new
  purchase order will be created to replenish it up to the maximum quantity.

   .. example::
      If :guilabel:`Min Quantity` is set to `5` and :guilabel:`Max Quantity` is set to `25` and the
      stock on hand falls to four, a purchase order will be created for 21 units of the product.

- :guilabel:`Multiple Quantity` can be configured so that products are only ordered in batches of a
  certain quantity. Depending on the number entered, this can result in the creation of a purchase
  order that would put the resulting stock on hand above what is specified in the :guilabel:`Max
  Quantity` field.

   .. example::
      If :guilabel:`Max Quantity` is set to `100` but :guilabel:`Multiple Quantity` is set to order
      the product in batches of `200`, a purchase order will be created for 200 units of the
      product.

- :guilabel:`UoM` specifies the unit of measurement by which the quantity will be ordered. For
  discrete products, this should be set to `Units`. However, it can also be set to units of
  measurement like `Volume` or `Weight` for non-discrete products like water or bricks.

Triggering reordering rules using the scheduler
===============================================

Reordering rules will be automatically triggered by the scheduler, which runs once a day by
default. To trigger reordering rules manually, navigate to the *Inventory* module and select
:menuselection:`Operations --> Run Scheduler`.

.. note::
   Manually triggering reordering rules will also trigger any other scheduled actions.

Managing reordering rules
=========================

To manage the reordering rules for a single product, go to the product page and select
:guilabel:`Reordering Rules`. To manage all reordering rules for every product, go to the
*Inventory* module and select :menuselection:`Configuration --> Reordering Rules`.
